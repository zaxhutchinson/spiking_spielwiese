Change Log for Spiking Spielwiese:
(Does not date to the start of the project.)

1/2/2019:
    - Adds PathExample
    - Adds CurrentOutNormalized method to Neuron class. This uses the sigmoid x/ (1+abs(x)) to squash the output. By default, Neuron pushes this normalized output into the outgoing synapses.
    
1/4/2019:
    - Separates lib files and example files, reworking makefile.
    - Updates values in some examples to accommodate for the changed to normalized neuronal output. Have not checked all. Gridwar, Trace, Target, Bee, and Path are fine.
    - Adds energy calculations to gridwar

1/5/2019:
    - Changes the pointer storage type of NT objects from shared to unique.
    - Changes the return value from NeuronTemplates::GetNeuronTemplate method from a shared_ptr to a non-owning raw pointer.
